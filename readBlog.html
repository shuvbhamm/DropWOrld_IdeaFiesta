            <h3 class="PostTitle">Who is the richest person in the world?</h3>
            <p>
                Who comes to your mind when we talk about the richest man on earth? Bill gates, jeff bezos and elon musk would be the first names to come to anyone’s mind.
                
                There were several kings and rulers in the past whose immense wealth was the centre of attraction. None of the current billionaires is the richest of all time. The title of the richest man of all time is believed to belong to Mansa Musa, the 14th Century West African ruler of Mali. Contemporary accounts of Musa's wealth are so breathless that it's almost impossible to get a sense of just how wealthy and powerful he truly was. Some historians believe that his net worth adjusted to current value would be $400 Billion. Some even believe that he was the world’s first TRILLIONAIRE.
                
                JOURNEY TO THE MECCA
                
                Mansa Musa’s journey to the mecca was the turning point in mali’s empire. Mans musa was accompanied by a caravan consisting of 60,000 men and women including a personal retinue of 12,000 slaves all clad in brocade and Persian silk.
                
                He took his entire royal court officials, soldiers, griots, camel drivers and 12,000 slaves, 100 elephants, 80 camels as well as a train full of food and water for everyone.Now if you go on a trip, you’ll probably take some cash to spend with you, and the king was no different. The only difference was, he was the richest man ever and his definition of “shopping money” was 21000 KG or 46,297 pounds of solid gold. Now, if you’re wondering, how did he transport such a huge amount of gold? Each one of the slave carried 2 KG of gold and 80 camels, each carried 300 pounds of gold, that’s how easy it was.
                
                It was not just a caravan, Mansa Musa was moving with a city through the desert.</p>

NORWAY IS BUILDING WORLD’S FIRST FLOATING HIGHWAY-

The rugged west coast of Norway, home to thousands, is a challenge to travel along by car. The harsh weather conditions make it an unpredictable route, with roads often closing and ferries often cancelling their departure due to snow, heavy winds or high waves. Steep, icy mountains and deep fjords make western Norway route famously scenic and will entertain most of the tourists. but it also makes life difficult for the people commuting for business or medical emergencies. <br><br>

Fortunately, the government of Norway has come up with a multi-billion dollar megaproject, “Coastal highway E39”, that will, hopefully, cut the driving time in almost half and make the journey ‘ferry free’. A continuous E39 highway that will be accessible 24/7, with fixed links between islands and the mainland will make the western coast more accessible for not only the people who are living at the coast, but also for tourists and for the transportation of goods. The $48 billion master plan aims to replace ferries with bridges and to create tunnels. <br><br>

The project’s most ambitious aspect is the development of submerged floating tunnels that sit around 30 metres under the surface of the water.Some of the norwegian fjords along the route are too wide or very deep for conventional infrastructure, which makes the mega project a complicated test for engineers and architects. The floating tunnel however, will be built within a fjord over 1400-m deep. The plan is to build it deep enough under the surface so as to allow the biggest ships to safely pass over but also ensure that there is enough room underneath to accommodate submarine passage.

The ambitious underwater tunnel project will make the passage easier, faster and cost efficient.

These new roads will also shorten the paths to hospitals, schools and markets, which will leave Norway with a sustainable, more diverse economy.

The Coastal Highway Route E39-project is the largest infrastructure project in modern Norwegian history, and possibly the largest on-going road project worldwide.
