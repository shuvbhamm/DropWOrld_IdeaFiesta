            <p>
                Who comes to your mind when we talk about the richest man on earth? Bill gates, jeff bezos and elon musk would be the first names to come to anyone’s mind.
                
                There were several kings and rulers in the past whose immense wealth was the centre of attraction. None of the current billionaires is the richest of all time. The title of the richest man of all time is believed to belong to Mansa Musa, the 14th Century West African ruler of Mali. Contemporary accounts of Musa's wealth are so breathless that it's almost impossible to get a sense of just how wealthy and powerful he truly was. Some historians believe that his net worth adjusted to current value would be $400 Billion. Some even believe that he was the world’s first TRILLIONAIRE.
                
                JOURNEY TO THE MECCA
                
                Mansa Musa’s journey to the mecca was the turning point in mali’s empire. Mans musa was accompanied by a caravan consisting of 60,000 men and women including a personal retinue of 12,000 slaves all clad in brocade and Persian silk.
                
                He took his entire royal court officials, soldiers, griots, camel drivers and 12,000 slaves, 100 elephants, 80 camels as well as a train full of food and water for everyone.Now if you go on a trip, you’ll probably take some cash to spend with you, and the king was no different. The only difference was, he was the richest man ever and his definition of “shopping money” was 21000 KG or 46,297 pounds of solid gold. Now, if you’re wondering, how did he transport such a huge amount of gold? Each one of the slave carried 2 KG of gold and 80 camels, each carried 300 pounds of gold, that’s how easy it was.
                
                It was not just a caravan, Mansa Musa was moving with a city through the desert.</p>
