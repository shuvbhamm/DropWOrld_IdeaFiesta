# DropWOrld_IdeaFiesta | Brocode | IdeaFiesta Hackathon 2022 

Some people don't want to share their identities with other people but instead choose to convey their ideas through writing blogs about contentious topics like religion, the caste system, hacking, and civil rights in addition to personal reasons. There is a danger of being exposed while expressing anything that is simply a random opinion, and you don't want other people to know about it, so some individuals stop writing blogs and sharing their opinions just for that reason. They also want to do something else because writing alone might get monotonous at times.
<br><br>
There is no requirement for users to provide their personal information in order to post their ideas and opinions in the form of articles or blogs on our website. For those who don't want to be seen on public platforms but yet want to offer something interesting and educational, this inventive random blog website will provide a solution to the privacy problem.
<br><br>
Another feature is a doing list where they can schedule both their daily activities and their writing work. Additionally, anyone will be able to participate in a fun quiz game that will challenge them and evaluate their knowledge.
Last but not least, we want to establish a blog website that is entertaining and educational so that people won't get bored writing and ca share their thoughts with absolutely 0% fear about their privacy.
