            <p>Some people don't want to share their identities with other people but instead choose to convey their ideas through writing blogs about 
                contentious topics  in addition to personal reasons. There is a danger of being exposed while expressing anything that is simply a 
                random opinion, and you don't want other people to know about it, so some individuals stop writing blogs and sharing their 
                opinions just for that reason.</p>
                <br>
            <p>There for There is no requirement for users to provide their personal information in order to post their ideas and opinions in the form of articles or blogs on our website.
